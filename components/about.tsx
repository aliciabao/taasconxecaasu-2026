        In 1977, the Intercollegiate Liaison Committee was founded at Yale
        University as the nation’s first intercollegiate Asian American student
        conference. In 1978, the conference was moved to Princeton University
        and renamed as the East Coast Asian Student Union. Finally in 2004 after
        27 conferences at 20 different college campuses, the annual conference
        would again be renamed to its current designation as the East Coast
        Asian American Student Union. As of 2018 after 42 conferences and 41
        consecutive years of uninterrupted growth, ECAASU remains as the oldest
        Asian American student conference in the nation.

        In Spring 2024, the Triangle Asian American Students Conference (TAASCON) was
        revived after a short break over the COVID-19 Pandemic by UNC Students
        for Asian American Studies (SAAS). SAAS is a grassroots organization
        that emerged in the fall of 2022 inspired by the dedicated efforts of
        the Asian American Working Group at UNC which successfully advocated for
        dedicated space for Asian Americans on campus, now known as the Asian
        American Center. <br /><br/>
        Since 2022, SAAS has been advocating for an Asian American Studies
        Program at UNC. Their primary objective is to promote and explore the
        diverse experiences and rich histories of Asian Americans. While
        establishing an Asian American Studies program is still a major goal for
        SAAS, they now also emphasize on our long-term vision for UNC and Asian
        America.​ They hope to create more space for Asian American political
        advocacy and discourse, radicalize and bring together Asian American
        students. <br /><br/>
        They draw inspiration from the radical political principles of the Asian
        American Movement in the 1960s, also prioritizing solidarities with
        other historically resilient communities, emphasizing that the issues in
        the Asian American community are deeply interconnected with broader
        histories of racial capitalism, systemic racism, oppression, and
        injustice.
