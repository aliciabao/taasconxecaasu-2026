        In 1977, the Intercollegiate Liaison Committee was founded at Yale
        University as the nation’s first intercollegiate Asian American student
        conference. In 1978, the conference was moved to Princeton University
        and renamed as the East Coast Asian Student Union. Finally in 2004 after
        27 conferences at 20 different college campuses, the annual conference
        would again be renamed to its current designation as the East Coast
        Asian American Student Union. As of 2018 after 42 conferences and 41
        consecutive years of uninterrupted growth, ECAASU remains as the oldest
        Asian American student conference in the nation.
